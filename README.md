# BioRxiv_Template
A nice (in my opinion) Latex template to communicate preprints to the bioRxiv

This is just a latex template to layout preprints for the bioRxiv.

The template allows single and two column layouts, includes bibtex and advanced table/figure support. Feel free to use it and modify it.

And please add a line in the Acknowledgements pointing to this Repo.

thanks

Sergio
